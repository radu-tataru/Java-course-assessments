      "answers": [
        { "text": "FileReader", "explanation": "FileReader reads characters but doesn't provide line-by-line reading" },
        { "text": "BufferedReader", "explanation": "Correct! BufferedReader provides the readLine() method for efficient line reading" },
        { "text": "FileInputStream", "explanation": "FileInputStream is for reading raw bytes, not suitable for text files" },
        { "text": "Scanner", "explanation": "Scanner can read lines but BufferedReader is more efficient for simple text reading" }
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "BufferedReader is the best choice for reading text files line by line because it provides the readLine() method and buffers the input for better performance.",
